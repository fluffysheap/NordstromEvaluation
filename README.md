If anyone happens to be using the Netbeans IDE, they should just be
able to open the project file which is included.  Failing that, the
source code is available in the following files, and most reasonable
Java IDEs should be able to import the project's source files:

NordstromEvaluation/src/nordstromeval/EvictionStrategy.java
NordstromEvaluation/src/nordstromeval/RandomStrategy.java
NordstromEvaluation/src/nordstromeval/Memcache.java
NordstromEvaluation/src/nordstromeval/LRUStrategy.java

And the test case file:

NordstromEvaluation/test/nordstromeval/MemcacheTest.java

JUnit test results (XML format) are in:

NordstromEvaluation/build/test/results/TEST-nordstromeval.MemcacheTest.xml

And my discussion of problem phase 2 is in:

NordstromEvaluation/phase2.txt
